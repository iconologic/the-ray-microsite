      <p>At Interface, Ray C. Anderson traveled a path he never imagined, all because he had the courage to ask,’What if?’ That question, and the answers to which it led, changed the world, igniting a global movement toward sustainable business practice and proving that a better way is possible. The Ray is the next leap in that journey, born of the same question: What if we start over and reimagine the way we connect our communities, our lives and our world in a way that’s safer, more responsive to the climate, more regenerative to the environment, more uplifting to the spirit and more capable of generating economic opportunity—today and for generations? The Ray is a proving ground for the evolving ideas and technologies that will transform the transportation infrastructure of the future, and it starts at home: on 16 miles of West Georgia's I-85, and the land and communities surrounding it, where Ray built his company and his life. By innovating from the ground up, we’re creating a corridor that reconnects and restores us, paving the way to a safer and more prosperous future for all.</p>

    	<p>From August to December 2014, a team of urban designers from Perkins+Will, under direction of Professor Richard Dagenhart, and eight graduate students from Georgia Tech's School of Architecture studied Ray Anderson's sustainability vision and engaged in a "deep dive" study of the highway corridor which extends from exits 2 to 18 on Interstate 85 in West Georgia.
			<br><br>
    	The design studio class members identified the characteristics of addressing pollution remediation, resource efficiency, wildlife conservation, life safety, cultural exchange and changing attitudes. They analyzed the existing conditions, both at a global scale and more locally within the Ray C. Anderson Memorial Highway.
